# Markdown Academy Conversation Format

Hi :wave: It looks you like our conversations and you would like to create one yourself, right?

[:no_good: Not really](#what-a-shame) [:+1: Sure!](#title)


##Â What a Shame
What a shame! But it's your choice to make this bot sad :crying_cat_face:
[> Quit]_(_quit)

## Title
So every coversation starts with the title and title is represented with a headline at the beginning of the conversation document such as

```
# My Awesome Conversation
```

Later on, you will be able to start the conversation by running `/markdown-academy my awesome conversation` anywhere from Slack.
